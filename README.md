I am currently an algorithm engineer at ByteDance, specializing in operations research optimization, parameter tuning and machine learning algorithms.

I obtained a master's degree in Computer Science from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2022. Prior to that, I received a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2019. I'm interested in fields such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.
